      <p>&quot;Bohemian  Rhapsody&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by  Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a  six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a  ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda.  The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. Upon  its release as a single, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; became a commercial  success, topping the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks</p>

      <h4><strong>Fun fact 1</strong></h4>
      <p><br>
      Queen are a  British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie  Mercury, Guitarist Brian May, Drummer Roger Taylor and  Bassist John Deacon. Their earliest works were  influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band  gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by  incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.</p>

      <p><strong>Not all artists are  drop-outs</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>People often think that rock stars dedicate their whole life  to music and hence are not much good in studies. A big blow to such  misconception is the Queen Band. Except Freddie Mercury, every other band  member has a post graduate degree. So, the Queen is actually pretty smart. It&rsquo;s  ok Freddi, that is not why they made you the lead singer; you are actually  good! A degree doesn&rsquo;t make you smarter, but educated.</p>

      <p>Freddie Mercury aka Farrokh Bulsara</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>When  Freddie Mercury was born, he was named Farrokh Bulsara as he belonged to an  Indian family from Gujarat. But later when he was studying in a boarding  school, he adopted the name Freddie Mercury. Strangely his name in the passport  is Fredrick Mercury. Again Freddie, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in a name.&rdquo; Did you even read  Shakespear ? What&rsquo;s there in it anyway.. ahemm..</p>

      <p><strong>&ldquo;I like to  ride my bicycle&rdquo; but Freddie didn&rsquo;t like to ride bicycle!</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>Quite contrary to the lyrics  of the song &ldquo;Bicycle Race&rdquo;, Freddie Mercury didn&rsquo;t like riding bicycle.&nbsp;In  the same song there is a line &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Star Wars&rdquo;. Reality was quite the  opposite as guitarist Brian May pointed out later that Freddie Mercury liked  Star Wars a lot.<br>
