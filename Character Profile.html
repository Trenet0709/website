      <p>Freddie Mercury (born  Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991) was a British singer,  songwriter, record producer and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded  as one of the greatest lead singers in the history of rock music, he was known  for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. <br>
        Born in 1946 in Zanzibar  to Parsi parents from India, he attended English-style boarding schools in  India from the age of eight, and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school.  In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England.  Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with  guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for  Queen, including &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;,  &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Don't  Stop Me Now&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;. He also led  a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.  Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS. He confirmed the  day before his death that he had contracted the disease. <br>
        As a member of Queen,  Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001,  the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In  1990, he and the band Queen were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding  Contribution to British Music. In 1992, a tribute concert was held at Wembley  Stadium, London. In 2002, Mercury ranked as number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of  the 100 Greatest Britons. The 2018 film about Mercury and Queen, Bohemian  Rhapsody, is the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. Rami  Malek won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Mercury in  the film, among critical praise and other accoladesGallery</p>

      <h4><strong>Fun fact 1</strong></h4>
      <p><br>
      Queen are a  British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie  Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Their earliest works were  influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band  gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by  incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.</p>

      <p><strong>Not all artists are  drop-outs</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>People often think that rock stars dedicate their whole life  to music and hence are not much good in studies. A big blow to such  misconception is the Queen Band. Except Freddie Mercury, every other band  member has a post graduate degree. So, the Queen is actually pretty smart. It&rsquo;s  ok Freddi, that is not why they made you the lead singer; you are actually  good! A degree doesn&rsquo;t make you smarter, but educated.</p>

      <p>Freddie Mercury aka Farrokh Bulsara</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>When  Freddie Mercury was born, he was named Farrokh Bulsara as he belonged to an  Indian family from Gujarat. But later when he was studying in a boarding  school, he adopted the name Freddie Mercury. Strangely his name in the passport  is Fredrick Mercury. Again Freddie, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in a name.&rdquo; Did you even read  Shakespear ? What&rsquo;s there in it anyway.. ahemm..</p>

      <p><strong>&ldquo;I like to  ride my bicycle&rdquo; but Freddie didn&rsquo;t like to ride bicycle!</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>Quite contrary to the lyrics  of the song &ldquo;Bicycle Race&rdquo;, Freddie Mercury didn&rsquo;t like riding bicycle.&nbsp;In  the same song there is a line &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Star Wars&rdquo;. Reality was quite the  opposite as guitarist Brian May pointed out later that Freddie Mercury liked  Star Wars a lot.<br>
